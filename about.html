<p> Hello there, my name is Enrique Rodriguez <br>
Interesting how you found this page.<br>
Since you magically found this webpage let me tell you about myself. <br>
I first started out simply being interested in photography<br>
then over time I invested more and more time into the idea <br>

After a year or so I have now gotten to where I am now. <br>
I am currently looking into creating a clothing brand<br>
while also still going to school for computer science. <br>
Here are things that I want to do
</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a website</li>
<li>Learn how to make applications</li>
<li>Create an adventure game</li>

</ul>
